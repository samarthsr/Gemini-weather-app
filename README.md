Weather Now by Samarth
Weather Now is a beautiful, real-time weather application that provides current weather conditions for any city in the world. Instead of relying on a traditional weather service, this project uniquely leverages the power of the Google Gemini API with Google Search grounding to deliver up-to-the-minute, accurate weather data.
The user interface is modern, responsive, and dynamic, featuring background colors and icons that change to match the current weather, creating an immersive user experience.
